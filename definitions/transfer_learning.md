## [Transfer Learning](#transfer-learning)

Modify a [pre-trained](#pre_trained) network that was designed to perform a certain task and trained on a lot to perform on a new task.

Kind of a shortcut to having to train a whole new network from scratch.

A simple implementation is to replace the [output layer](#output-layer), and then [fine tune](#fine-tuning) it to perform another task.
