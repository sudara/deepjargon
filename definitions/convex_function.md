## [Convex Function](#convex-function)

Bowl shaped function where there's only one bowl.

If you pick two points on the function and draw a line between them, the line will be above the bottom of the function.

The local optimum is the same as the global optimum.

When [gradient Descent](#gradient-descent) operates on a convex function, it's guaranteed to find the global optimum.
