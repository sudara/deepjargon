## [Artificial Neural Network](#artificial-neural-network)

A bunch of connected [neurons](#neuron) that when trained, learn to perform tasks such as image [classification](#classification).

These neurons are organized into "layers" that perform different tasks that occur in the following order:
1) [One input layer](#input_layer)
2) [Any number of hidden layers (including zero)](#hidden_layer)
3) [One output layer](#output_layer)

Often just called a [Neural Network](#neural-network).
