## [Development Set (Dev Set)](#dev-set)
*Hold-out Cross Validation Set*

A small percentage of the [Dataset](#dataset) used to check which [trained model](#trained-model) performs the best.

Traditionally, 20% of the data if you have only a few thousand [training examples](#training-example). On modern, larger datasets it can be just 1% of the data if you have a million training examples.

The dev and [test Set](#test-set) should have the same [distribution](#distribution).
