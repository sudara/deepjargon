## [Reinforcement Learning](#reinforcement-learning)
*RL*

A machine is given a goal to achieve and earns points for doing well but is not told how to solve the task. It learns through trial and error.

Example: Robot with four legs gets points based on how far it gets crossing a room. The further it goes, the more points it gets. The robot is not told **how** to walk and has to figure that out.
