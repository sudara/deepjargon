## [Epoch](#epoch)

A runthrough of all [training examples](#training-example) used to train an [artificial neural network](#artificial-neural-network). 

Not to be confused with [batch](#batch).

Once the machine has seen every single training examplar it has finished an "epoch" of learning. This doesn't mean that training is over though. Often, machines will be trained for many epochs.
