## [Epoch](#epoch)

Running all [training examples](#training-example) through the network once.

Not to be confused with [batch](#batch-size).

Once the machine has seen every single [training example](#training-example) it has finished an "epoch" of learning.

This doesn't mean that training is over though. Often, models will be trained for many epochs.
