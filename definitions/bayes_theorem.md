## [Bayes' Theorem](#bayes-theorem)
*Bayes' Rule | Bayes' Law*

Bayes caught me predictin' without priors.

How much you should trust evidence given other variables.

Describes the probability of an event given other probabilities that are related to the outcome.

For some reason, the examples are often medical.

$${\displaystyle P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}}$$
