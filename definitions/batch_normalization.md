## [Batch Normalization](#batch-normalization)
*Batch Norm | BN*

Similar to [normalization](#normalization) but performed on activations instead of the original [feature](#feature).

Insulates and decouples [layers](#layers) from each other so that [weights](#weights) in later layers aren't as impacted by changes to weights in earlier layers.

Has a small [regularization](#regularzation) effect when used with smaller [batch sizes](#batch-size).
