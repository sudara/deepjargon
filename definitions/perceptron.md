## [Perceptron](#perceptron)

Some kind of cyclops Transformerâ„¢?

A [neuron](#neuron) that outputs to a binary 1 or 0 value.

$$
{\displaystyle f(x)={\begin{cases}1&{\text{if }}\ w\cdot x+b>0\\0&{\text{otherwise}}\end{cases}}}
$$

Back in the 1950s, when [Neural Networks](#neural-network) were in black and white and single layered, the perceptron was where it was at.
