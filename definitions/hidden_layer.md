## [Hidden layer](#hidden_layer)

A layer of [neurons](#neuron) in an [artificial neural network](#artificial_neural_network).

Neurons in the hidden layer take the data from the previous layer, transform it in some way, and then pass the transformed data to the next layer of the network. Hidden layers always occur between other layers of neurons.
