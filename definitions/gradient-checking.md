## [Gradient Checking](#gradient-checking)

Test whether or not [gradient descent](#gradient-descent) is working as planned by computing the derivatives when the parameters are increased or decreased by a small amount (epsilon), such as 10^-4.

$${\displaystyle \frac{J(\theta+\epsilon)-J(\theta-\epsilon)}{2\epsilon}}$$
