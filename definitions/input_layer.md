## [Input layer](#input_layer)

A layer of [neurons](#neuron) in an [artificial neural network](#artificial_neural_network).

This is the first layer of a neural network that directly evaluates raw data. For example, a neuron in this layer may evaluate the greyness of a single pixel in a greyscale image. The relevance of this information is weighted and passed to the next layer of the network.
