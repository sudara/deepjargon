## [Convolution](#convolution)
*Cross-Correlation | Sliding Inner-Product*

Combining two things with the power of fancy math.

In a [convolutional layers](#convolutional-layer) of a [cnn](#cnn), one or more [filters](#filter) are convolved with the input image, resulting in new images.

In math notation, the symbol `*` is used for convolution, which totally not confusing given that `*` is used for multiplication in most programming languages. Have fun, everybody!
