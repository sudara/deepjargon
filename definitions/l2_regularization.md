## [L2 Regularization](#l2-regularization)
*Weight Decay*

Reduces [overfitting](#overfitting) by enforcing that the model keep to smaller [weights](#weights), leading to a smoother fit of the data.

It does this by penalizing larger weights in the model, adding [lambda](#lambda) amounts of the sum of the square of the weights to the [cost function](#cost-function).

Most common form of [Regularization](#regularization).
