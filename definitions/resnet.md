## [ResNet](#resnet)
*Deep Residual Learning*

Makes really deep networks with lots of [layers](#layer) work better by routing the inputs not only to the start of the network but to intermediate layers as well.

Deeper networks perform well but are tough to train and can suffer from [vanishing gradients](#vanishing-gradients) when they get larger.

This type of network won 1st place in classification at [ILSVRC](#ilsvrc) 2015.
