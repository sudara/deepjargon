## [Hyperparameters](#hyperparameters)

A faster-than-light method of travel used in—wait, what?

Variables set before the learning starts.

The trial and error nature of tuning these is why [Grad Student Descent](#grad-student-descent) has been so important.

Examples:
* α [Learning Rate](#learning-rate)
* β [Momentum](#momentum)
* [batch size](#batch-size)
* number of [layers](#layer)
* number of [neurons](#neurons) in the [hidden layers](#hidden-layer)

If your parameters are too hyper, ask your doctor about what Ritalin can do for your model.
