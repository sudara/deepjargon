## [Early Stopping](#early-stopping)

Literally stopping early.

Stopping what early? Training the model, such as with [gradient descent](#gradient-descent). Yay for terms that do what they say on the box!


Why stop early? To reduce [overfitting](#overfitting).

Early stopping is a form of [Regularization](#regularization).
