## [Gradient Descent](#gradient-descent)

The meat and potatoes of deep learning. The Math that makes it all possible.

The well worn metaphor: You are on the top of a hill, using an algorithm to get down where you take lots of tiny steps, each time reassessing what the fastest way "down" is.

> It's taking fucking forever to shuffle down this hill, this can't be efficient...
