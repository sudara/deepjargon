## [Linear Regression](#linear-regression)

A [Regression](#regression) method to predict where something falls on a sliding scale. For example, someone's weight or height. 

In linear regression, the prediction is a simple one, for example, you are given a person's height and have to guess their weight: you might predict that the lower their height, the lower the weight.

It's called "linear" regression because if you draw a graph with the predictor (e.g., height) and prediction (e.g., weight) on the axes, you draw a straight line (e.g. as height gets bigger, so does weight).

For a prediction NOT on a sliding scale see for example, [Logistic Regression](#logistic-regression)
