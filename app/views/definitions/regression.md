## [Regression](#regression)

A method to make predictions.

For example, a computer is given a set of photos and told which contain cats and which don't. Now it has to predict whether or not a new photo contains a cat.

[Neural networks](#neural-network) build on regressions.

There are different kinds of regressions depending on the type of data you have. For example:

[Logistic regression](#logistic-regression) 

[Linear regression](#linear-regression)
