## [Regression](#regression)

A method to make predictions.

For example, a machine is given a set of photos and told which contain cats and which don't. Now it has to predict whether or not a new photo contains a cat.

[Neural networks](#neural_network) build on regressions.

There are different kinds of regressions depending on the type of data you have. For example:

[Logistic regression](#logistic_regression)

[Linear regression](#linear_regression)
