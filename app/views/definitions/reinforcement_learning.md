## [Reinforcement Learning](#reinforcement-learning)

Also know as RL. 

A machine is given a goal to achieve and earns points for doing well but is not told how to solve the task. It learns through trial and error.

Example: Goal: Robot with four legs gets points based on how far it gets crossing a room. Getting further = more points. Robot is not told how to walk though and has to figure that out.
